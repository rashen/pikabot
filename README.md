# Pikabot
A Discord bot for managing member-created lists. Channel members can manage their own memberships with:

* `/groups create <group>`
* `/groups join <group>`
* `/groups leave <group>`

All groups are strictly cosmetic and the member need to have the `create invite` permission to be able to create their own list.
